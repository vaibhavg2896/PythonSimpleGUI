#Guess The Number
 One of the simplest two-player games is “Guess the number”. The first player thinks of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess. In this game,  the computer will take the role of the first player while you play as the second player.You can decide the range and start new game at any instance of gameplay.You will be given 7 or 10 numbers of attempts.
